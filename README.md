# Tile Generator
To use ML and mood to generate tile

1. Grid -> Tile (Intersection -> dualPts) [Zhilong]
2. Tile Wireframe for fixed symmetry, save points (Automatically fulfilled by #1) [Zhilong]
3. optical flow (Done) -> area (l1, l2 define curve -> vertices) [Zhilong]
4. Optical Area OR (或操作) Tile Area, save plot vertices (实际要画的) [Zhilong]
5. Plot Tiles using vertices (Let py5 do the job) [Zhilong]
6. Queue for plotted vertices (先进先出) [Zhilong]
